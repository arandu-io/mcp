# The first check is the one that matters most, and it is not a style rule: go
# test only runs a file whose name ends in _test.go. A file named DiskTest.go --
# or disk_Test.go, which is the same mistake with a different hand -- compiles
# into the package as ordinary code and none of its tests ever run. No error, no
# warning, a green build with the suite switched off.
#
# Every check that asks the toolchain a question treats a question that could
# not be asked as a failure. A guard that goes green because `go list` broke has
# checked nothing and said everything was fine.
